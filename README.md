# About Project

Motivated by a quest to find more about "Data Analyst" like what skills are needed, top-paying jobs, and most in-demand skills for a data analyst role, this project was born from a drive to identify top-paying roles and in-demand skills, simplifying the process for others seeking optimal career paths.

Data was sourced from my SQL Course, providing insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and crucial skills.

Key questions I aimed to address through my SQL queries include:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools Used

In my comprehensive exploration of the data analyst job market, I leveraged the capabilities of several essential tools:

- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, SQL enabled me to effectively query the database and extract crucial insights.
- PostgreSQL: As the selected database management system, PostgreSQL proved instrumental in managing the vast job posting data efficiently.
- Visual Studio Code: This versatile platform served as my primary tool for database management tasks and executing SQL queries with ease.
- Git & GitHub: Vital for version control, Git, and GitHub facilitated seamless collaboration and provided a structured platform for sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, fostering teamwork and project transparency.
-  Microsoft Excel: Visualizing SQL query results, providing a user-friendly interface for data analysis and presentation.

### 2. What are the skills required for high-paying data analyst jobs?


This SQL script fetches top-paying data analyst jobs and their required skills. It creates a CTE called "top_paying_jobs" to select job ID, company name, job title, average yearly salary, and posted date for the top 10 highest-paying data analyst positions. These are filtered based on specific criteria and sorted by salary. The main query then selects these job details along with associated skills from related tables.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
SELECT
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date :: DATE
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
